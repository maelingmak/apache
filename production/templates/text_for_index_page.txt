Background:
What is a web server?
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to 
serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests,
which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.

What is Apache?
Originating in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server, is a free and open-source 
cross-platform web server, Approximately half of all web servers on the
internet today are running Apache. The origins of the internet as we know
it are because of the existence of the Apache HTTP Server.

What is a SQL Injection?
SQL injection is a type of security exploit in which the attacker adds SQL
code to a Web form input box to gain access to resources or make changes to
data.

Analysis:

Using 51 access logs from a small server that had all databases and PHP
removed in order to avoid SQL injection and other similar security 
vunerabilities, we analyzed traffic from February to April 2018. This server
had intentionally been left offline since the end of 2015 in order to "fall
off the radar" of many bots and potential attacks.

We attempted to find the geolocations of each website visit, then analyze
the traffic for potential threats by comparing the IPs to those on known
malware lists and by the methods used, URL requested, and user agents making
the request.

Results:

We'll figure this out when we have the visualizations. I am planning to do
the data I found in class today by the URL requested on tomorrow. Mostly,
it's what I expected: Attempted SQL injection. There are some surprises as
to how many people/bots tried to use curl and urllib. I will have to figure
out how to explain that tomorrow.
