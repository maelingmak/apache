Background:
What is a web server?
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to 
serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests,
which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.

What is Apache?
Originating in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server, is a free and open-source 
cross-platform web server, Approximately half of all web servers on the
internet today are running Apache. The origins of the internet as we know
it are because of the existence of the Apache HTTP Server.

What is a SQL Injection?
SQL injection is a type of security exploit in which the attacker adds SQL
code to a Web form input box to gain access to resources or make changes to
data.

Analysis:

Using 51 access logs from a small server that had all databases and PHP
removed in order to avoid SQL injection and other similar security 
vunerabilities, we analyzed traffic from March 2015-December 2015 and 
February 2018-April 2018. This server had intentionally been left offline 
since the end of 2015 in order to "fall off the radar" of many bots and 
potential attacks.

We attempted to find the geolocations of each website visit, then analyze
the traffic for potential threats by comparing the IPs to those on known
malware lists and by the methods used, URL requested, and user agents making
the request.

Results:

Though several years had passed between the two sets of logs, the primary
types of entry methods were the same.

(Will take the mean of each for each date range to normalize, then quote
some stats and do visualizations.)
